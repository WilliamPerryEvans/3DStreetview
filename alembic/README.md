Generic single-database configuration.

In general, we recommend to **always backup the entire database before performing any migration activities**.

To generate tables from scratch with a new deployment, run:
```
alembic upgrade head
```

To prepare a new database migration after changes in models, run:
```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "name of change"
```
where `"name of change"` can be replaced by any meaningful succinct string that describes the change made. 
To ensure a non-version controlled database gets version controlled to the most recent change, type:
```
alembic stamp head
```
Replace `head` for the revision the database obeys to in case relevant.
Then revise the upgrade and downgrade functions in the prepared migration script to ensure the migration happens in
the way you want, and no data gets lost.

To upgrade a production database after this change do `alembic upgrade head` again.

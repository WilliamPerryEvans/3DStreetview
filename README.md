# How to use the 3D Streeview Dashboard
This is a short 'how to' tutorial on using the 3D Streetview Dashboard being developed by [Rainbow Sensing ðŸŒˆðŸ“¡](https://rainbowsensing.com/)

As an example, let's say you want to create a 3D mesh of [The Lawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lawn),  historic center of the University of Virginia, in Charlottesville.

Here is an aerial image showing the area of interestâ€”note the large building at the far right known as the Rotunda, this is the area we will focus on. To capture this, **or any other <u>environment**, follow these steps:

1. Go to https://3dstreetview.org/dashboard/ 

2. Sign in or get an account if you do not have one already by clicking â€˜Guestâ€™ in the top right corner and then register for an account

3. Now, on the left panel you should see an option called â€˜Mesh projectsâ€™, click this

4. To create a new mesh, select the â€˜createâ€™ tab and proceed to fill out the necessary information.
If you do not have the coordinates ready, you can go on Google Maps or OpenStreetMap to get them. For example, go to the exact location you want on Google Maps and then simply left click, you should then have the latitude and longitude appear at the pin you created. 
  
Or, if you prefer a more open-source method, simply go to [OpenStreetMap](https://osm.org/), zoom to the exact spot you want to collect your coordinates, right click and press 'show address' - it will appear on the screen for you to record.

- Latitude: 38.03536
- Longitude: -78.50355
- Mesh name: The Lawn Test (for example)

Now under ODK project selection you will have to select the server you are using. I donâ€™t know which server you are using, but put in the correct URL! For instance: crankyserver.com

And again, under ODM project selection you need to select a server. For instance: https://3dphotocollect.org/

Then do some stuff under Project and hit â€˜saveâ€™
